TPS C3 outreach project to study the Crimestoppers platform for reporting cybercrime.
Crimestoppers is an anonymous crime reporting system that has worked for decades but it is not clear that it is the appropriate platform for cybercrime.
Does the current platform work, need adjustment, or is a new platform needed?
Here are current online ways of reporting online-related crimes; there are no platforms or websites specific to cybercrime for Toronto Residents:
